# claudeskills

A collection of MCP servers and Claude Code skills that give Claude direct access to your codebase and visualization toolchain.

Each tool lives in its own subdirectory and registers itself as an MCP server with a single setup command.

## MCPs

### `codesearch/` — Search 100K+ source files in milliseconds

When your codebase is too large to fit in context, `codesearch` gives Claude a search engine instead. It indexes your entire source tree into [Typesense](https://typesense.org) and exposes structural C# queries via [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io), so Claude can find exactly what it needs without you copy-pasting code into the chat.

- **Scale:** handles monorepos with 100,000+ source files across C#, C++, Python, and more
- **Two-layer search:** Typesense narrows the haystack to ~50 candidate files in milliseconds; tree-sitter then parses each one for precise AST-level matches
- **Structural queries:** find all callers of a method, implementations of an interface, usages of a type, fields of a given type, classes with a specific attribute — not just text matches
- **Always fresh:** a file watcher incrementally updates the index on every save; a heartbeat process auto-restarts the server if it dies
- **Zero copy-paste:** Claude calls `search_code` or `query_cs` directly and gets back ranked results scoped to the right subsystem

**Tools:** `search_code`, `query_cs`, `service_status`

See [`codesearch/README.md`](codesearch/README.md) for setup and usage.

### `d3figurer/` — Publication-quality figures from natural language

D3.js produces the most precise, beautiful data visualizations in the browser — but the API is large and the coordinate math is unforgiving. `d3figurer` pairs Claude's ability to write and iterate on D3 code with a persistent headless Chrome renderer, so the feedback loop is code → render → fix in seconds.

- **AI writes code, not pixels:** Claude generates `figure.js` files that produce clean, editable SVG — not rasterized screenshots. You own the source and can regenerate at any size or format
- **Instant layout QA:** `check_figure` detects overlapping labels, clipped text, and elements spilling outside the canvas so Claude can fix problems before you even open a browser
- **No context bloat:** rendering happens in a separate persistent process; Claude gets a short success/error message, not base64-encoded image data — keeping the conversation clean across many render-edit cycles
- **Production formats:** a single render produces PDF (vector, print-ready), PNG (raster for web/slides), and SVG (editable in Illustrator/Inkscape)
- **Version-controlled figures:** each figure is a small CommonJS module — diff changes, regenerate on CI, share source alongside output
- **18-figure gallery:** real examples from a published AI book covering flow diagrams, timelines, bubble charts, dumbbell charts, area charts, and network diagrams — each a working starting point for Claude to adapt

**Tools:** `render_figure`, `check_figure`, `server_status`

## Installation

Each MCP is self-contained and registers itself via a single setup script:

```bat
codesearch\setup_mcp.cmd
d3figurer\setup_mcp.cmd
```

Then restart Claude Code. The tools for each MCP will be available in your session.
